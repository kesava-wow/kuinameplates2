* aura options "use default ui filter" and "use whitelist" have been removed;
  The default behaviour is now to use the vanilla UI's filter, but
  KuiSpellListConfig can still be used to modify the spells displayed,
  including tracking any auras caused by other players.
* add "whitelist all own auras" and "blacklist all other auras" options

* add slash-command shortcuts - i.e. type /knp auras or /knp a to open
directly to the auras config page (this uses page names from the locale)
* increase default small font size slightly (from 9 to 10)
* increase default castbar height slightly
* brighten default castbar colour slightly
* remove brackets from around player guild text

* add koKR localisation contributed by yuk6196 (thanks!)
* add ruRU localisation contributed by BLizzatron (also thanks!)
* add Roboto Condensed Bold to ruRU clients and use it by default

1-aug

directly to the auras config page (this uses page names from the locale)
* remove brackets from around player guild text

29-jul
* reimplement custom aura filtering. Use the beta of KuiSpellListConfig to
customise the filter.

27-jul
* config page elements are created on-demand, rather than all at once (which
should slightly reduce the pause when you first open the config interface)

* aura options "use default ui filter" and "use whitelist" have been removed
in preparation for changing the way in which the aura filter can be edited.
KuiSpellList isn't used anymore, so obviously KuiSpellListConfig will have no
effect. Currently it filters in a way similar to the old "use default ui
filter" option (i.e. shows other players' CCs, etc).
* add koKR localisation contributed by yuk6196 (thanks!)
