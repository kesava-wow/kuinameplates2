# Kui Nameplates
Prettier nameplates. Download releases [at Curse](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/kuinameplates).

This is a complete rewrite of Kui Nameplates for Legion support. The rewrite separates nameplate frame creation, event handling and visible frame creation such that each of these components is easier to maintain. It also supports third-party layouts.

Reporting issues
----------------
Issues submitted [here](https://github.com/kesava-wow/kuinameplates2/issues) won't necessarily receive a response, but I do read all of them. If you just want to ask a question or get in touch with me, the comments on [Curse](http://mods.curse.com/addons/WoW/kuinameplates) are a better option. I try to respond to all of those.

When submitting an issue:
- Separate distinct issues into multiple tickets. It's easier to work with that way.
- If you've modified code, try to reproduce the issue without your modifications first, and tell me what you've changed.
- If reporting a spell missing from the Auras whitelist, please submit it to the [KuiSpellList repo](https://github.com/kesava-wow/kuispelllist/issues) instead.
- Remember I'm human. Though I do main a Draenei.
